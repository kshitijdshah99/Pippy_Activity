## Project Description

Pippy is the Sugar "learn to program in Python" activity. It comes with lots of examples and has sufficient scaffolding such that a learner could modify an existing Sugar activity or write a new one. The goal of this project is to add "co-pilot"-like assistance to Pippy. A learner should be able to ask the AI to provide example Python code to help them navigate the language and explore possibilities in a more open way than the collection of Pippy examples affords. Besides correcting code and providing example to kids the project aims to help developers navigate through Sugar-toolkit and also GTK basics helping them contribute in more effective way. Our AI-assistant model would provide contributors sufficient examples to understand how the sugar codebase works.

## Pippy AI-assistant
To proceed with the developments of AI models and integrating in Sugar activities mainly involves 4 different phases of development, which are as follows.
1. Development of the AI-model
2. Upgrading the UI of the existing activity
3. Integration using fastAPI
4. Deployment on AWS servers using Docker
