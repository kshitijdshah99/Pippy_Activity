# Pippy_Activity

## Introduction 📝
Our purpose of intgrating LLM in Pippy-Activity is quite clear. Making co-pilot quite similar like github but on a much elementary level and easy to use for children. Python codes which LLM generate are based mainly for developers to understand beacause its trained on a data of codes of developers available on internet. There are chances that the code generated by these models may be difficult for kids to understand beacause many a times kids are unable to give structured and clear prompts. This results in hallucinations in our model.
