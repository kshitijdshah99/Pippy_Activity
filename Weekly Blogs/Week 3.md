# Progress till NowðŸ“ˆ
Up until week 2, I had completed the implementation of a model that could create Python code for children while also correcting them as needed. Last week, I encountered a major difficulty with training and loading Large Language Models, prompting me to modify my strategy from fine-tuning to a RAG-based approach.

# Week 3
This week, I spent the most of my time looking for adequate pygame documentation that included all of the intricacies and functionality of the methods utilized in this Python module. When it comes to functional use cases, Pygame is a somewhat large Python package. This makes it useful for a wide range of tasks and activities.
Sugar's codebase is entirely composed of Python and Sugar GTK code, with Pygame serving as its basis. Recently developed Sugar activities are mostly designed with Pygame.

This is the [document](https://github.com/kshitijdshah99/Pippy_Activity/blob/main/Pygame%20Documentation.pdf) I discovered on the internet. It's pretty descriptive, but I altered it to meet the requirements.

This documentation covers several ideas, to summarize them:

1.Basic principles taught were pygame introduction, dealing with shapes, pictures, text, and drawing graphics primitives.

2.Intermediate techniques included playing music and constructing a graphic user interface (GUI).

3.Advanced notions include creating an app, a basic board game, or even tiles for it.
