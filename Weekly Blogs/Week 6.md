# Progress till NowðŸ“ˆ
In the 5th week I had designed a rough figma design for the Pippy's new UI look. I had to talk about the same with the mentors. Main goal was to keep the UI consistent as much as possible with respect to all other Sugar-activities where chatbot was to be integrated. For an instance I tried keeping UI similar to that of Chat Activity which my co-mentor was making.

# Week 6
This week was spent in doing 3 tasks namely which where quite experimental and time consuming too.
1. Setting up Sugar
2. Exploring the Pippy repository
3. Making a roadmap so as how to develop UI.

## Setting up Sugar
Instead of doing dual boot I preferred using a Virtual Machine as it gives us more flexibility to work with the desktop environment. However this task consumed most of my time this week.
### Issues I had encounteredâš 
I had previously setup Sugar using live-build on debain and packed sugar on ubuntu, however I had faced many challenges like RAM allocation, not possible to maximize full screen, lot of lag in opening Sugar activities which made it difficult for me to contribute to the desktop environment. 

### Solution
To overcome this problem I once again started setting-up packed sugar on a virtual machine having Ubuntu on it. I had allocated 100GB of space to it hence there was minimal lag this time. Once Ubuntu was setup I did following steps.

**1. Installed Packed-sugar using help of this [documentation](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/blob/master/docs/development-environment.md)**
 
**2. Downloaded dev tools like VS code**

**3. And started installing other tools like Zephyr**

**4. Increasing the size of Ubuntu screen** - This issue personally took a lot of time to get sorted. If like me anyone is facing any issues with this I recommend to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/w4E1iqsn_wA?si=P60lWiJbKu9-9FY8).

For those who read my articles, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MhydijWmc&pp=ygUbc2V0dGluZyB1cCB0aGUgdm0gb2YgdWJ1bnR1) to be quite useful for installing Ubuntu on a virtual machine, you can surely refer for the same.

# Exploring the Pippy Repository
This was quite challenging because I was not familiar with the Pippy's codebase. I had asked mentors for a personal meet if I was unable to sort out things well. 
The repository was quite big having many
