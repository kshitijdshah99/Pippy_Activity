By the conclusion of Week 3, I had integrated pygame documentation into my RAG model, as well as the fundamentals of code correction and code generation.
Pygame was used to create the UI for Sugar activities, while GTK was utilized to customize the toolbar and other functions. 
GTK was a crucial feature of the Sugar codebase. As a result, I was looking for documentation about it at this point.

# Week 4
The majority of activities created in Sugar nowadays make use of Pygame for interactive dashboards and customizable play. 
Historically, sugar operations included GTK as a key component. This is the official [documentation](https://www.gtk.org/docs/) for GTK,
where we can get all of the information we need.

The majority of Sugar developers are currently utilizing GTK3, an enhanced version of GTK, to construct activities. 
My job is to create a manual with basic details on the most often used GTK methods in Sugar.
