# Outline
Last week as discussed I completed with the the python code generation part and the code correction part.
I tried looking at how good the models where at correcting kids code and the accuracy was quite profecient.

# Week 2
I started this week looking at proper datasets for code correction. 
These where some of the datasets which I had found online on kaggle and some other websites like hugging face. I dicussed these details with my mentor Walter and got an approval from him saying it works as long as things don't get complicated for kids.

I did try training the model on google colab on following datasets but I observed following issue.
