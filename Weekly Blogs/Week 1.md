# Google Summer Of Code'24 Starts
In the pre-GSoC and community bonding period I understood orgs mission, goal and the style of operation. I got familiar with the Sugar desktop environment and also what I have to do in my project for this summer. **My task was to Add an AI-assistant to Pippy activity in Sugar.**

### Tasks performed during this period:
1. Setup Sugar environment locally
2. Try out different LLMs
3. Decide the LLM Architecture
3. Finalise workflow
4. Communicated with my peers

#### Setup Sugar environment locally
Sugar is a desktop environment built for kids. To explore the different activities within it I decided to setup locally. I used packed sugar to try out differnet activities.

#### Try out different LLMs
This project involves code generation hence it opens up lots of opportunity for different LLMs to work with. I tried out various open-source models because sugarlabs supports FOSS only. Some of the LLMs which I tried were LLama2, Gemini, codellama, mistral, bloom, Llama2, GPT2 and many more. I have shared some of these codes in this repository for reference. 

#### Decide the LLM Architecture
We can enhance productivity of above stated LLMs using many approaches like fine-tuning, rag approach, prompting and using agents. On experimenting out these architectures I found fine-tuning and rag approach is the best.

#### Finalise workflow
Once model and architecture were short listed based on their performance metrics I started finalising the workflow for the AI part of this project.

#### Communication with my peers
This was one of the most intresting part of community bonding period. I discussed with my mates working on their AI based projects for GSoC and DMP at Sugarlabs. They brought a lots of LLM knowledge on board. For chatbot related projects fine-tuning prooved quite good. Music-blocks a part of sugarlabs had many AI projects. Many of them used LLama3 model because of it's testing parameters reaching level upto that of openAI's GPT4. Llama3 was recently released in the open-source market.
