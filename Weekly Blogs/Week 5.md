# Progress till NowðŸ“ˆ
Last week, I finished integrating all of the functionality in our co-pilot model. Although the models were accurate, I wanted to eliminate hallucinations as much as possible. 
My mentor Walter suggested starting with UI and then improving efficiency of the LLMs later.

# Week 5
I was bit confused in the start of this week on what to include as a part of Sugar-activities hence my mentor Ibiam advised me to make a new documentation for Sugar activities
this documentation would contain all the releveant content related to sugar-activities.

Once the documentation was done I shifted my focus in developing the figma design of the Sugar UI. This design included all the stuff like position of chatbox on the 
toolbox, it's color, font, name, symbol, window space and also a proper chat interface.

At last, I completed my setup of Sugar on


Ibaim suggested that some of these topics be added in the revised documentation.



**1. Hello-World activity**
   
   Ofcourse Sugar has a lot of activities, therefore their codebase and logic are rather complicated for the model to grasp.
   To address this issue, I inserted the Hello-World activity, which is a basic activity in Sugar. It's built with Python GTK3+.
   It provided a clear example for users to understand how GTK is an integral part of the Sugar-codebase.
   
   Here's the Repo link for the same - https://github.com/sugarlabs/hello-world

**2. Sugar Toolkit GTK3+**

   This is essentially a website dedicated to studying the Sugar toolkit GTK3+. This is the most important and fundamental building component for developing Sugar activities.
   So from here I basically fetched stuff that was frequently used in contributing to Sugar. sugar3.activity.widgets is one of them that I have included in my documentation 
   because of it's high usage.

   This is the website link for the same - https://developer.sugarlabs.org/sugar3
