# Progress till Nowüìà
Till now I had made a rough figma design and finalised it with my mentors. The design had been created keeping in mind the needs of the developers who contribute to the Sugar codebase. Perrie helped me in improvising the design I had proposed.

# Week 7
This week I almost completed the development of the Pippy's UI making it possible for the model to be integrated in. I completed the Figma design in the following steps.
1. Created an AI-assistant icon using Inkscape
2. Integrated the icon
3. Developed a window
4. Created a query bar and send button
5. Messages in form of chats
6. Beautification of those chats
7. Adding of AI chats

## 1. Created an AI-assistant icon using Inkscape
Last week I had encountered some issues in making the icon. After Walter's suggestion I made it on Inkscape and set it's Dimensions to 55X55. Another part which I took care of that was to make it conistent throughout the Sugar codebase. So I communicated with my co-mentee Qixiang Wang who was working on chat-activity and we finalised on this icon.

Here's a look at the icon.

## 2. Integrating the icon in Pippy
This is the look of the icon intgreated in the toolbar.

## 3. Developed a window
This window would be the place where the AI-assistant would be answering the kids query.

## 4. Created a query bar and send button
The UI of the query bar and send button was actually kept consistent to the chat Activity.

## 5. Messages in form of chats
I then implemented messages which would be sent once the sent button was clicked. Besides this I solved all issues like that if the text box is empty the sent button should not send a null string and many more.

## 6. Beautification of those chats
The text which used to be sent had no proper boxes or proper design hence I made bubbles and beautified them keeping them consistent to the chat activity as you can see.

## 7. Adding of the AI chats
Here I implemented a real time mechanism where the AI-bot would be generating query whenever the is a user prompt. Currently the AI-model has not been integrated with the UI hence the Chatbot messages are not corresponding to the user's query.

## Miscellaneous features
Other features like, the chat window closes only when the user clicks back again on the Chat icon. I tried to make the UI as consistent as possible to the Sugar activities without compromising the features.

# Summary
This week I am almost done with modifying the Pippy's UI with all the core features we required. Above is the example for the same.

# Plan for next weeküìù
Next week onwards I would be starting with the integration and also do the necessary modifications required in the Pippy's UI as suggested by mentors.
