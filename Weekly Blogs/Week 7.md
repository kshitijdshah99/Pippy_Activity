# Progress till NowðŸ“ˆ
Till now I had made a rough figma design and finalised it with my mentors. The design had been created keeping in mind the needs of the developers who contribute to the Sugar codebase. Perrie helped me in improvising the design I had proposed.

# Week 7
This week I almost completed the development of the Pippy's UI making it possible for the model to be integrated in. I completed the Figma design in the following steps.
1. Created an AI-assistant icon using Inkscape
2. Integrated the icon in the toolbar
3. Developed a window
4. Created a query bar and send button
5. Messages in form of chats
6. Beautification of those chats

## 1. Created an AI-assistant icon using Inkscape
Last week I had encountered some issues in making the icon. After Walter's suggestion I made it on Inkscape and set it's Dimensions to 55X55. Another part which I took care of that was to make it conistent throughout the Sugar codebase. So I communicated with my co-mentee Qixiang Wang who was working on chat-activity and we finalised on this icon.

Here's a look at the icon.
