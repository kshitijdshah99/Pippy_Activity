# Progress till Nowüìà
Till my 10th Week I had been successful in making a RAG model run locally. Now my target was to integrate it loaclly so as to check whether it was working or not.

# Week 11
This week I tried to integrate the model with the UI of the Pippy Activity locally. My plan was that if I am successful in running the model locally then it would be pretty easy to run it on cloud computing servers like AWS, Microsoft Azure.

## Issues I encountered‚ö†
The major issue was that there where several errors due to conflict in the dependencies which created a lot of trouble for me. As mentioned in the last blog that I had created a seperate conda environment to run the Llama3.1 LLM, now the issue was that when I tried run the Pippy activity in the same conda environemnt it was unable to understand gi and many other libraries giving rise to lot's of error and warnings to. This made it difficult for me to start with the integration of the project.

## Setting up Sugar-live Build
I was working on the issue mentors had provided to me, for that downloading live-sugar was a must hence I built live-sugar on my local VM.

# Summary
This week I tried a lot fixing up dependencies error which I encountered. Performed trial and error to resolve them but no fruitful results where obtained.


# Plan for next weeküìù
Next week I would be communicating with mentors and co-mentees regarding this issue and try to resolve all these issue as soon as possible making it easy for us to work with.
